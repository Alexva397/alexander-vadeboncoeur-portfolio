# alexander-vadeboncoeur-portfolio

## Objective
    My objective was to create an online portfolio, something that introduces myself and displays my work.
    
## Implementation    
    I created placeholder objects for future projects to be displayed.
    I included links to my online presence, Github, Linkedin, recent resume, and personal contact information.
    I Created a responsive layout, that sizes and restyles the website based on the viewport.
